        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! It is a please to meet you here! Welcome to my Resume! My name is Jai Menon. I am a Malayali Indian origin Canadian who currently resides in the United States of America. I was born to Indian Parents in the Canadian province of Ontario, though when I was ten years old I moved to the Province of Alberta, and three years after that I moved across the border to the United States of America, and now reside in the State of California. Just this year I moved from the Bay Area in Northern California to Riverside in Southern California. Due to my heritage, I can understand English, French, Hindi, and Malayalam, a huge advantage as it allows me to communicate with an enormous number of people in the world. I am currently in my first year of University, attending the University of California, Riverside. <br><br>

        In this University, the University of California Riverside, also known as UCR, I am a CHASS Student, studying in Pre-Business in order to eventually get a degree in Business Administration. Due to the high number of Advanced Placement (AP) Courses I had taken throughout the course of High School, I only need to attend approximately two and a half years of University, as I have already accrued a considerable amount of University Credits. This tehcnically makes me a Sophomore despite me being a first year. After obtaining my degree in Business Administration, I hope to then attend a good Law School, with success and passing there helping me fulfill my dream of becoming a lawyer, namely one in the Cooperate field. A Cooperate lawyer is my ideal job as it both gives me good pay and allows me to do good for my community, as I can help people who have been wronged or harmed by shady Cooperate practices. Giving back to the community is a major interest of mine- I have already volunteered in several places, notably at a library and Taekwondo Dojo, both in the Bay Area. While they benefit my University Application, I took great satisfaction in giving back to my community and helping those around me.<br><br>

        Outside of studies and work, I have several hobbies to keep me entertained. These most notably include video games and sports. For the latter specifically, my favorite sports are Tennis, Swimming and Skiing. I enjoy Tennis due to its high-speed nature, as well as the sheer amount of exercise it gives me. In the case of Swimming, I enjoy the fact that it can genuinely save my life, or the lives of others, in the event of danger around a body of water. For skiing, I love the pure rush of speed I feel while going down a mountain very quickly. The aforementioned Taekwondo is another passion of mine, as I love the exercise, discipline, and sense of community it gives to those who practice it, and I also love the connection it has to a completely different culture, that being Korean Culture. I have taken numerous other sports, such as Soccer and Football throughout my life, though it was these 4 sports that have stood out and become my favorite, to the extent where they partially define who I am today.
